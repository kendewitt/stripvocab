When I lived in Japan, I was called to do volunteer work.
The family I was going to help out asked me to cook meals for them.
My Japanese was very limited, and as such, I did what I could to learn how to cook for large numbers of people.
It turned out that a lot of my Japanese cooking was spaghetti with a sauce of butter, sugar, milk, and eggs.
But I was determined to succeed and at least cook one meal.
I felt I had failed.
But, they did not.
They looked pleased and they asked me for recipes for future meals.
That meant a lot to me.
When I was expecting my son, we had a long wait.
The adoption agency sent me to a local restaurant to get some easy meals for the family in the waiting room.
The waitress let me know that the cookbook she kept on the shelf was in English.
I picked it up and she asked if she could look at it.
She asked where I was from and where I was adopting.
And then she asked how I planned to cook and where I planned to take my baby boy after his adoption.
Wow.
That is what I call support.
So, if you don't think you can do it, do it anyway.
